# S3 – Bucket Setup and Permissions

## ✅ What I Did
In this DIY project, I created an Amazon S3 bucket, configured public access settings, and uploaded an object to the bucket. I also explored permission settings to understand how to make content accessible or private.

## 💡 Why It Matters
Amazon S3 is one of the most widely used AWS services. This project helped me learn how to:

- Create a bucket
- Configure access control (ACLs and block public access)
- Upload and manage files in S3
- Understand the basics of S3 permissions and URL structure
