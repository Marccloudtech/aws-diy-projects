# EC2 – Change Instance Type

## ✅ What I Did

In this DIY project, I launched an EC2 instance, then stopped it to change its instance type. After changing the instance type, I restarted the instance and confirmed that the changes took effect.

## 💡 Why It Matters

Changing an EC2 instance type is a common task for adjusting performance or cost. This exercise helped reinforce the steps involved in safely stopping, modifying, and restarting EC2 instances without data loss or errors.

It also helped me better understand:
- How EC2 instance types differ
- What needs to be done before resizing (stopping the instance, choosing a compatible type)
- The effect of instance types on cost and capability
