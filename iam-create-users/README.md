# IAM – Create Users and Policies

## ✅ What I Did
In this DIY activity, I used the IAM (Identity and Access Management) service to create new IAM users and attach the appropriate policies. I learned how to use the IAM dashboard, define user roles, and understand basic permission structures.

## 💡 Why It Matters
IAM is a foundational part of AWS security. This exercise helped reinforce the importance of creating least-privilege access for users. It also helped me understand how policies work and how permissions are attached.
